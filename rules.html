			<h1>Rules</h1>
			<p>
				Preparing and implementing a set of rules and protocols is essential for the ideal functioning  of every system. Similarly, we at Doon Fantasy League are striving to prepare an application that is not only user-friendly, but also relatively free of glitches and major malfunctions.<br><br>

				Each player would be allotted a fixed budget of $50 million to assemble a team of 8 players  which will include three substitutes. Wise and judicious choices need to be made while handling the budget and selecting your first draft of team as there is no concept of free transfers in this application. Every transfer would deduct 5 points from the participants’ overall DFL score. A participant need not choose players according to the positions as all players will be available at all playing positions. The substitutes will not be awarded any points while they are benched. They can always be switched with players form your main team if there is a case of any injury or one of the players is not performing upto their expectations. The budget cannot exceed $50 million and no transfers can be made while the matches are in play.<br><br>

				For every point scored by a player during an inter-house match, he would be awarded one point. Similarly, the players would be awarded one point for each assist, two points for every steal and two points for every block, providing the referee doesn’t call it a foul. Two points would be deducted for each foul and a penalty of 5 points would also be extracted if the player is fouled out. There will be no negative points for any of the violations made during the game. <br><br>

				Despite the disparity in the prices and the skillsets of Seniors-A and Seniors-B players, the marking scheme would remain the same for all players of this Inter-House. This is because all players, despite their team level (SA and SB), they will be facing opponents of their own prices and skillsets and hence the competition would be even. Providing more weightage for the Senior-A players would have been unfair for the Senior-B players and vice versa. <br><br>
