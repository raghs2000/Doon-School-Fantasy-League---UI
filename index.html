			  		<h2>From the team</h2><span>Welcome to the Doon School Fantasy League!</span>
			  		<p>
			  			The concept of Fantasy Leagues on the internet has become a sensation across the world. Taking a cue from its popularity, some like-minded, ambitious Doscos have been working on an innovative project to formulate a domestic fantasy league for the upcoming Inter House Basketball competition. In order to forge this dream into a success, we request the school community to actively engage in this event.
						It was a month back when we came up with this pioneering idea to develop a league similar to the Fantasy Premier League for our own Inter-House competitions. Most of us must be familiar with the Fantasy Premier League, but for those who are not, it is an online game wherein participants assemble an imaginary team of real life soccer players and score points based on those players' actual statistical performance or their perceived contribution on the playing field. Fantasy football, in recent years, has evolved from a simple recreational activity to a global forum for keen football fans due to exposure via the internet.<br><br>
						Now, you must be thinking how incorporating such an app into our school community would be beneficial for us. The answer is pretty simple. It would help us tabulate and analyse figures and statistics of sporting events in a better and more comprehensive way, and would also create a buzz around the school, leading to increased participation in Inter-House events. The application will encourage Doscos to observe sporting matches more keenly and will cater towards a commendable increase in the number of spectators for various competitions. The statistics acquired from this application will further give an in-depth, detailed reference as to how each house team and player performed in the competition.  <br><br>
						This application is solely intended for recreational purposes and does not intend to hurt the sentiments of any individual or house at any cost.  
						For any further queries, please feel free to contact us on this email or personally too. <br> #LET_THE_GAMES_BEGIN!

			  		<h2>Kushagra Bansal</h2><span>School Basketball Captain</span>
			  		<p>
			  			The Basketball court is home to many of us including me. The sport gives the perfect end to a Dosco’s year and I am content that I get to conclude my valedictory year at Chandbagh with the thing closest to my heart. This year, the stage has been set and each house expels its unparalleled “josh” and propaganda for the year’s most heart throbbing inter-house competition. I, as the School Basketball Captain fervently wish for a healthy competition with all teams performing. All houses have put in hours of practice; inter house competitions being witnesses to the fact that hard work beats talent and I deem for a similar result this year. In the junior competition, commendable performances were exhibited by Aryan, Kanishk and Rajveer, leading their teams through victorious matches and inspiring the D and C formers to incept the sport. The intensity of the competition persists as we plunge into the senior segment and I wish to witness exemplary performances by all the five houses. The Doon School Fantasy League allows the school community to understand the game and perceive it from an extremely technical and strategic manner. It presents an indisputable view of the game, endorsed by the evidence and statistics from the actual games. The app also attempts to effectively calculate the MVP, most underrated player and other superlatives through surveys and comprehensive calculations using input from the score sheets and gameplays at the conclusion of the competition. I personally invite each individual to indulge in this game and to commence on this digital journey through this year’s inter house competition simultaneously recognising the unfathomable efforts of the fantasy team that made this pedestal possible and available to us.

			  		<h2>Lakshman Santhanam</h2><span>Hyderabad House Basketball Captain</span>
			  		<p>
			  			Having a team of consistent and well renowned players is a privilege for a captain and I am fortunate to behold such a privilege. High expectations have been placed on Hyderabad house’s shoulders, but through practice and perseverance, we hope to display to our supporters not only a certain degree of dignity and class, but also the ‘josh’ that our house is known for. Practices have been going smoothly with great zeal shown by all the members. Having such reliable members assisting me, including school teamers as well as other experienced players, this year’s campaign looks promising as we place our bid for the house cup. The Nizams have already managed to clinch seven sports’ House cup trophies out of eleven and it’s my responsibility as the captain to end the year on a winning note. With only a few days left for the competition to commence, I am expecting phenomenal results from myself as well as our team.

			  		<p>
			  			With the onset of this year's basketball competition, Kashmir House expects to clinch a clean sweep of all the trophies. With numerous school team players and a fairly seasoned team, we have extreme confidence in our squad. The fantasy application is quite an interesting idea, and adds exponentially to the thrill of inter-house sports, and garner a fervent following. It gives everyone a quality and an accurate insight into the true workings of the competition. In the junior category, rising talent can be seen in players such as Aryan Agarwal and Ruhaan Goel. In the senior category, already prominent, but ever improving players such as Kushagra Bansal and Hamza Hussain can be seen leading from the front, where as Shourya Mann is the driving force of our Senior's B team. Our confidence in our team is also fuelled by the chemistry and co-ordination of the trio of Kushagra Bansal, Hamza Hussain and I, who have been playing together since our C-Form.

			  		<p>
			  			Basketball is one of the sports which demands not only a huge amount of commitment, but also immense energy and zeal, to put it in Dosco lingo, josh. Due to paucity of time this year, Oberoi House practices were held at the untimely hours of 6 in the morning. I was amazed to see the amount of enthusiasm displayed by the entire team. I believe that our team has got a few cards up our sleeves that might just make all the difference this season, the most important one being Paarth Agarwal. He will be the keystone to our team’s configuration with his his sublime blocks and rebounds which are certainly something worth seeing. With the entire school holding its breath to see who clinches the cup, Oberoi House strives to play hard and deliver a stunning performance in order to end this season on a winning note.

			  		<h2>Aayush Chowdhry</h2><span>Jaipur House Basketball Captain</span>
			  		<p>
			  			This year Jaipur House hopes to add to the title race. Last year’s senior cup winners look to mount their charge with more than half of their squad still intact. Led by Aayush Chowdhry,  the Eagles will look to their heights for inspiration when it matters most. New faces Ishan Roy, Nishith Agarwal and Vijayaditya Rathore promise to make their senior debuts ones to remember. As their veteran captain sits out injured, the question remains, will the men in green be able to pull a rabbit out of the hat? But a rather promising line-up looks to upset all odds sand keep the senior’s cup for the third year running.

			  		<h2>Ritwik Saraf</h2><span>Tata House Basketball Captain</span>
			  		<p>
			  			This year's Basketball Season has been one of great promise for Tata house. The house is led by Ritwik Saraf from the front, who has been a dedicated captain and managed to produce a well balanced senior team. Budding talents like Aditya Singhee and Rishin Reddy in the Seniors A team, will have a chance to prove their worth in the matches to come. Furthermore, Harrsh Dewan has been a motivating factor for the juniors as he never fails to impart his in-court experiences and tips. The Seniors B team, known for its speed and agility, also looks promising with the likes of Udbhav, Nandil and Ribhu Khan. Even though the junior team are underdogs in their category, they don’t fail to impress by exhibiting the true Warrior Spirit. Moreover, The Fantasy Basketball League is providing an incentive to the teams to put in their best and motivating them to improve their game and give in all they’ve got.
